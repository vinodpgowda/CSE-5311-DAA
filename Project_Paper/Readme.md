## Introduction

The B-tree is a balanced tree data structure widely used in database systems for efficient storage and retrieval of large datasets. This repository explores the implementation details of a B-tree and includes benchmarking experiments to evaluate its performance across varying dataset sizes.

## Implementation

- `BTreeNode` class: Represents individual nodes in the B-tree, containing keys and child pointers.
- `BTree` class: Manages the overall B-tree structure, supporting key operations like insertion, search, and deletion.

## Benchmarking

The repository includes benchmarking scripts that measure the performance of B-tree operations (insertion, search, deletion) across different dataset sizes. The benchmarks provide insights into the efficiency and scalability of the B-tree implementation.

## Appendices

- **Appendix A**: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete B-tree implementation and benchmarking scripts.
- **Appendix B**: Detailed benchmarking data collected during experiments.
- **Appendix C**: Supplementary figures illustrating performance trends and analysis for B-tree operations.

## Repository Contents

- `B-Trees.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the B-tree implementation and benchmarking scripts.
